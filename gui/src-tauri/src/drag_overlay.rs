// glued to the cursor for the duration.
//
// Why an overlay window: the chip used to render inline with
// position:fixed inside the originating webview. That clipped to the
// WebView's bounds and vanished the moment the cursor crossed past
// them — and JS-driven mouse routing across overlapping webviews in
// the same process is unreliable enough that we couldn't keep the
// chip glued via DOM events alone. A separate borderless transparent
// always-on-top webview, repositioned every frame from a Rust
// background thread reading the global cursor via Tauri's
// cross-platform API, gives us a chip that follows the cursor
// anywhere on screen — over our own windows, over external apps,
// over the desktop — without any of those routing concerns.
